# Instamojo API Android library

This Android library provides seamless integration of Instamojo APIs into your Android application.

All most all the APIs are integrated except two which will be updated ASAP.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Add this Android package as a library to your Android application.
2. `Instamojo` is basic class to access all the APIs. The method names are self descriptive.
3. All background thread handling is performed within the APIs itself.
4. Just call the API with a implementation of `HttpResponseCallback`.

Stay tuned for the demo application using this library.
